### 1. Problem Statement
#### THEME:
Retail Commerce

#### PROBLEM NAME:
Catalog indexing engine

#### DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 - Merchant catalogs can be of different types, as per the category e.g. grocery, fashion, electronics, etc;
 - Each catalog will have multiple items with each item (SKU) defined using attribute key/value pairs that defines a particular aspect of the item (e.g. colour, product name, price, etc.);
 - Optimal catalog search, using structured query or unstructured text, requires an efficient indexing engine that can support either type of search for catalogs of any size;
 - Unstructured queries typically use an inverted index (e.g. elasticsearch) that facilitates efficient retrieval of documents associated with the search query;
 - Inverted index can also be used to engineer prompts for catalog LLMs.

#### SUBMISSION  :
Traditional **inverted indexes** are falling short. Their reliance on keywords alone hinders comprehension and adaptability. This innovative submission utilizes cutting-edge neural search paradigms to:

 - **Unlock Semantic Understanding**: Go beyond keywords to capture meaning, offering relevant and nuanced results.
 - **Embrace Dynamic Adaptations**: Learn from data, constantly improving relevance and tailoring results to user intent.
 - **Empower Customization**: Leverage flexible models like RAG and LLang Chain Agents, easily adapting to your specific needs.
